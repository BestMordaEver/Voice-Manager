### Voice Manager creates temporary voice/text channels on demand! [Here's what it looks like](https://i.imgur.com/xNKVC2B.mp4)

**TLDR: Designate a lobby and direct everybody who enters to be placed in a newly created voice channel with a private text chat. Once everybody leaves this new channel both will be automatically deleted and logged, leaving no clutter behind!**

- Matchmaking lobbies to direct users to existing channels
