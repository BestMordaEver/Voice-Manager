Voice Manager is a bot, that allows your users to create new voice channels on demand! [Here's what it looks like](https://i.imgur.com/xNKVC2B.mp4)

Assign a lobby and everybody who enters this lobby will be placed in a newly created channel. Once everybody leaves this new channel - it gets deleted, so there's never any clutter!

Voice Manager is highly customizable!
- You can make your own template for new channels' names, that can include your username, tag or a game that you play!
- Bot can do ordered channels! Check out `%counter%` combo in `vm!help lobbies`.
- Give your users granular control over their new channels with `permissions` command! Let them kick the killjoys or change thier channel name to something stupid!
- Create private text chats, that are visible only to those, who enter your channel!
- Matchmaking lobbies! Nobody knows how they work but they are extremely cool!
