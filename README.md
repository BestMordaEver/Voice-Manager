Voice Manager is a simplistic bot, that allows your users to create new voice channels on demand!

Assign a lobby and everybody entering this lobby will be placed in a newly created channel. Once everybody leaves this new channel - it gets deleted.

The bot will keep new channels in the same category as the lobby and will enable same user limits as the lobby.

List of available commands:
- help (or empty mention) - shows help message
- register channelID - registers voice channel as a lobby
- unregister channelID - unregister lobby
- list - shows all lobbies and their IDs, also shows how many new channels exist
